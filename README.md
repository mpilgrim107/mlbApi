## mlbApi

This program will gather MLB Stats from the 2023-24 season using the 'mlb-statsapi' package in Python.  

The 'AddTables.sql' file is a script to add all of the tables to the local database that has been set up.

Once the data has been collected, the data will then be stored in the local database using the 'psycopg2' Python package.
